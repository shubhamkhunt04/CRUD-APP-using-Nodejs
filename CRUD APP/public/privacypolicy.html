            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit
                the “Site”.</p>

            <h3>Personal Information We Collect</h3>

            <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
                information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on
                your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages
                or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about
                how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device
                Information.”</p>

            <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous
                    unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit <a
                        href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</li>

                <li>“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser
                    type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</li>
                <li>“Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you
                    browse the Site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device
                Information and Order Information.</p>

            <h3>How do we use your personal information?</h3>
            <p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in
                particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by
                generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the
                success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>

            <h3>Sharing your personal information</h3>

            <p>We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as
                described above. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the
                Site&#8211;you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/"

            <h3>Behavioural Advertising</h3>
            <p>As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or
                marketing communications we believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted
                advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at <a
